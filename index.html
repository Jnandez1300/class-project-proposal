  <h1>Pong de la fury</h1>
	<p>Team Members:Julian Hernandez</p>
<h2>Application Overview:
Pongs de la fury:Based on the original game where players control paddles on either side of the screen, 
	and they use these paddles on either side of the screen and they use the paddle to hit a ball back and fourth.
	The objective is to score points by causing the ball to pass the opponent's paddle without them being able to return it.
	It will go up until the score of 3.
 </h2>
<h3>Technology Overview:
<p>Turtle Graphics Library: Turtle is a Python feature like a drawing board, which lets you command a turtle 
to draw all over it. This library is used to create the game window and all graphical elements within it.
Game setup: The game window is created with a title of "Pong de la Fury," a black background color,
and a size of 800x600 pixels. The `tracer(0)` function call turns off animation rendering, which improves performance.
Game Elements:
Paddles: Two rectangular paddles (paddle_a and paddle_b) are created using Turtle. 
They are positioned on the left and right sides of the screen, respectively, and are controlled by the players.
Ball: 
A square-shaped ball is created at the center of the screen. Its initial movement direction (dx and dy) is set to move diagonally.
Player Controls: Keyboard bindings are set up to control the movement of the paddles. 
Players can use the 'w' and 's' keys for paddle_a and the up and down arrow keys for paddle_b.
Main Game Loop: The game runs within an infinite loop. Inside this loop, 
the game continuously updates the screen, moves the ball, checks for collisions with the borders, 
and handles collisions with the paddles.
Collision Detection:
	Border Checking: If the ball hits the top or bottom border, its vertical direction (dy) is reversed. If it goes beyond the left or right border, it returns to the center with a change in horizontal direction (dx).
   Paddle and Ball Collisions: If the ball collides with a paddle, it reverses its horizontal direction (dx), simulating a bounce.</p>

<h4>Proposal Last Updated 3/22/24 </h4>
<h5>Feature List:
<p>Paddles:Players control paddles on either side of the screen which they use to hit the ball.
Ball:a ball move back and fourth between the paddles and players must hit it with their paddles to keep it in play.
Scoring:points are scored when a player hits the ball past their opponents paddle.
Collision Detection: the fame includes collision detection to determine when the ball collides with a paddle or the boundaries of the screen.
Speed variation:as the game progress the ball goes faster.  </h5>
<h5>Future Feature List: ball will be on fire and it will be sped up to make it more challenging.
There will be the ability to play two players.</p>
</h5>
<h6>Basic Technical Features:
	Game Loop: Runs an infinite game loop to continuously update the game state and handle player inputs.
	Utilizes the `update()` function to refresh the screen and display changes.
Customization:
   Provides flexibility in adjusting game window dimensions through the `wn.setup()` function.
   Allows for customization of paddle and ball sizes through the `shapesize()` function.
User Interaction:
   Provides visual feedback to users through paddle and ball movement on the screen.
    Offers responsive controls for an interactive gaming experience.
</h6>
<h7>Advanced Technical Features:
<p>Utilizes double buffering techniques to optimize rendering and prevent flickering during screen updates.
Implement more precise collision detection algorithms, considering the shape of the ball and paddles for accurate collision detection.
Introduce more realistic physics simulation, such as ball spin, angle deflection upon collision, and variable ball speed based on the paddle's velocity at impact.
Develop an AI opponent with different difficulty levels, 
capable of tracking the ball's movement and adjusting paddle position accordingly for challenging gameplay.</p>
